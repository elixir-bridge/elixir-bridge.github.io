## Lazy vs Eager loading

#### Eager
When we are eager loading - all operations need to execute before completion

Example: 

```elixir
Enum.map(1..10_000_000, fn(x) -> x * x end)
```

What would happen in the above example?

#### Lazy
Operations are performed only at the last minute

Instead of peforming the operations, it returns a precomputed function.

Lets look at an example and figure out what is happening below

```elixir
Stream.cycle([1, 2, 3])
#Function<59.87278901/2 in Stream.unfold/2>
Stream.cycle([1, 2, 3]) |> Stream.take(10) |> Enum.to_list
```

Streams are composable, lazy enumerables. A stream is any enumerable that generates items one by one.

`Stream.cycle/1` will create a stream that will cycle through a given enumerable infinitely.

Notice how the following function returns a stream.

```elixir
Stream.cycle([1, 2, 3])
#Function<59.87278901/2 in Stream.unfold/2>
```

Now looking at Stream.take, `take(enum, count)` - takes an enumerable and a count as arguments. It lazily takes the numbers of items from the enumerable equal to the count, and stops the enumeration. 

In this case 
```elixir
Stream.cycle([1, 2, 3])
#Function<59.87278901/2 in Stream.unfold/2>
Stream.cycle([1, 2, 3]) |> Stream.take(10) |> Enum.to_list
```

It the stream would take the first 10 items. 


`Enum.to_list` will convert an enumerable to a list. 


If we took out the `take` function and just had the following - 
```elixir
Stream.cycle([1, 2, 3]) |> Enum.to_list
```

Why would this be a problem?

Hint: Stream.cycle will run infinitely.
